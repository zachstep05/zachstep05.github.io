Mira gave me (Zach) this recipe when I was in Naples in October of 2018. She gave it to me after we baked a dozen, at that time I did not know this was my great grandmother Mary's recipe, but I thought they were delicious. Later, when I was told that this was a family 'secret', I felt honoured. I wanted to treasure it and keep it safe; but a rectangular piece of paper laying on wet, sticky conter-tops isn't the best place for safekeeping. So, I decided to make this website, dedicated to the recipe. Here it can be accessed by any worthy member of the family for as long as the internet lives (so forever I guess?).</font></b></h2><div class="row"><img src="IMG_3064.JPG" alt="cookies" style="width:98%" class="center"></div><div class="card"><div class="container"><p><h5><strong><font size="4">Makes 2-3 dozen<br><br><em><font size="5">INGREDIENTS</font></em><br>1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened<br>1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar<br>1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>1 egg<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>3/4 cups flour<br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>1 and 1/2 cups oats<br>1 cup chocolate chips<br><br><font size="2">NOTE: the <em>original</em> recipe has 1/2 cup of choc-chips and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.
