<h3>Motivational salience</h3>
<p>Motivational salience is a cognitive process and a form of attention that motivates an individual's behavior towards or away from a particular object or outcome.<br>
Motivational salience regulates the intensity of behaviour and amount of time and energy that a person is willing to expend to attain a particular goal, and the amount of risk that an person is willing to accept while working to attain a particular goal.
<br><br>
Motivational salience is composed of two component processes that are defined by their attractive or aversive effects on an individual's behavior relative to a particular stimulus:<br>
incentive salience and aversive salience.
<br><br>
 Incentive salience is the attractive form of motivational salience that causes approach behavior, and is associated with operant reinforcement, desirable outcomes, and pleasurable stimuli.
<br><br>
Aversive salience is the aversive form of motivational salience that causes avoidance behavior, and is associated with operant punishment, undesirable outcomes, and unpleasant stimuli.
<br>
<h3>Addiction:</h3>


During the development of an addiction, the repeated association of stimuli (in this case dopamine) triggers an associative learning process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as cues. These previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience (which manifests as a craving) <br>
– ex:
So, if an individual remains abstinent from drug use for some time and encounters a drug cue, a craving for the associated drug may reappear.
<br><br>
In addiction, the "liking" of stimulus becomes dissociated from "wanting" (i.e., desire or craving) due to the sensitization of incentive salience. 
<br>
In fact, if the incentive salience associated with drug-taking becomes pathologically amplified, the user may want the drug more and more while liking it less and less as tolerance develops to the drug's pleasurable effects.
<br>
<h3>Dopamine</h3>
Dopamine is an organic chemical.<br> It functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells.<br> The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior (Motivational salience). The anticipation of a reward increases the level of dopamine in the brain. 
Dopamine signals the perceived motivational outcome, which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.
